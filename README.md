## Overview

This repository serves as a reference for understanding and implementing basic data structures and algorithms. Each program is designed to showcase the core functionalities of its respective data structure or algorithm.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Selection Sort

File: selectionsort.c  
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. This program demonstrates how to sort an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element and moving it to the sorted portion of the array.

### Stack

File: stack.c  
This program implements a Stack data structure with essential operations:
- Push: Add an element to the top.
- Pop: Remove the top element.
- Peek: View the top element without removing it.

### Infix to Postfix Conversion

File: infixtopostfix.c  
This program converts an infix expression (standard arithmetic format) to a postfix expression (Reverse Polish Notation). The conversion uses a stack to handle operators' precedence and associativity.

### Queue

File: queue.c 
This program implements a Queue data structure, supporting:
- Enqueue: Add an element to the end.
- Dequeue: Remove an element from the front.
- Peek: View the front element without removing it.

### Singly Linked List

File: singlylinkedlist.c  
This program demonstrates the implementation of a Singly Linked List, which consists of nodes containing data and a reference to the next node. Operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Binary Search

File: binarysearch.c  
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. This program implements binary search with recursive and/or iterative approaches, making it suitable for sorted datasets.

### AVL Tree

File: avltree.c
An AVL Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree. This program showcases insertion, deletion, and re-balancing of nodes to ensure logarithmic time complexity for search operations.
